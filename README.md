You are excited for the road ahead as you have landed a short term gig to develop a Web ApplicationLinks to an external site. for a private organization. You have assembled the Team for this project.

Phone numbers
Credit card numbers
Time in 12-hour or 24-hour format
HTML tags
Hashtags
Currency amounts
The Task
In order to extract the required data from the hundreds of thousands of pages of string response you get from your API, you have decided to unleash the raw power of Regular Expressions. You already know how the specific types of data you are looking for appear in the string. This is how you have summarized that information, now all you have to do is write your Regular Expressions:  

Email addresses:
user@example.com
firstname.lastname@company.co.uk
URLs:
https://www.example.comLinks to an external site.
http://subdomain.example.org/pageLinks to an external site.

Requirements
I have created group sets for this assignment under the name Regex Onboarding Hackathon - GROUPS. Go to the People menu on Canvas and under the groups tab join a team of your choice.
Your GitHub should be created with your ALU email address
Any group can choose a minimum of 5 challenges out of the 8 for this hackathon (You can also opt to do all of the challenges, which will have the three challenges become bonuses)
Create a GitHub repo named "alu_regex-data-extraction-groupN," where N is your Group number. Therefore, for instance, the repository name of Group One will be alu_regex-data-extraction-group1
Every team member must commit code at least once. Your contribution will be checked using an automated tool
You can use Python or JavaScript for implementation.
Have FUN and Happy Coding!
